# Carson Sollis – Engineering Portfolio
Aerospace Engineering student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University  
Focus: Rocket Propulsion | Spaceflight Operations  
## Summary
I am a freshman Aerospace Engineering student with a strong interest in launch vehicle design and rocket propulsion. My work focuses on conceptual vehicle design, system-level thinking, and hands-on engineering projects, including building small rockets and creating tools to evaluate launch vehicle options.
## Featured Projects
###  LEO Rocket Design Study
Conceptual two-stage launch vehicle designed to deliver a payload to low Earth orbit.
- System-level vehicle sizing and mass estimation
- Structural configuration and material selection rationale
- Propulsion selection and trade studies
- Final technical report writing and organization

###  MATLAB Rocket Selection Tool
MATLAB program that takes user-defined payload and orbital constraints and filters a database of publicly available launch vehicles to find acceptable options.
- Focus: Data handling, filtering logic, and presenting results clearly
- Tools: MATLAB, Excel
- Output: Filtered rocket options with performance and cost information
